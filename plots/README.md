Plots accompanying the study.
Main figures from the manuscript this accompanies. 
Additional plots in variant_viz directory:

* ceph_samplot: samplot images of dnSVs called in the CEPH cohort. Each image has the sample in whom the dnSV occurs (labeled "sample") along with the offspring of that sample if any (each labeled "kid"), the parents of that sample ("dad" and "mom") and grandparents if available.
* sfari_samplot: samplot images of dnSVs called in the SFARI SSC cohort. Each image has the sample in whom the dnSV occurs (labeled "sample") along with the parents ("dad" and "mom").
* somatic_rd: read depth plots from GATK-SV of the entire cohort's normalized coverage for variants identified as somatic mosaic. Normalized coverage of each sample for the variant region is shown for each sample with the sample in whom the variant was called as well as the parents of that sample shown in red or blue (red indicates deletion, blue duplication).
